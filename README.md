# Driving with Genetic Algorithms

This repository contains code to train neural networks in "cars" using a genetic algorithm approach to enable them to drive in a track. In every iteration, 

The code for the neural network was written from scratch.

I used the map assets from this repository: [link](https://github.com/Dairop/Racing-cars-with-genetic-neural-network).
